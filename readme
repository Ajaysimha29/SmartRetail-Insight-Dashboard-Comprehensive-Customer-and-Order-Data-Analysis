# SmartRetail Insight Dashboard: Comprehensive Customer and Order Data Analysis

## Project Overview

SmartRetail Insight Dashboard is an interactive data analytics and visualization project designed to provide actionable insights from the Olist e-commerce dataset. This project integrates multiple data sources related to customers, orders, payments, products, sellers, and reviews to enable a holistic understanding of retail dynamics. Using Python and Streamlit, the dashboard offers data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling capabilities to analyze customer behavior and support business decisions.

## Dataset

The project uses multiple CSV datasets from the Olist e-commerce dataset archive, including:

- `olist_customers_dataset.csv`
- `olist_geolocation_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_items_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_payments_dataset.csv`
- `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv`
- `olist_orders_dataset.csv`
- `olist_products_dataset.csv`
- `olist_sellers_dataset.csv`
- `product_category_name_translation.csv`

All datasets are stored locally under the path: `C:\Users\ajayj\Desktop\archive`
